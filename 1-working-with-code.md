# My first Class

To reiterate what I have learned in my first class.

It was an amazing experience, the days leading up to it I was so nervous, I was so scared of the intensity of the course that I tried to master the entire pre-course work, even though I did not even understand what confused me. I managed to make it trough the days leading up to the course, and I found it so pleasant to experience a coding course online. I did not have to worry about the added stress of traveling to a new place, questioning public transport and finances, meeting strangers and learning something absolutely new. I could sit in the safety of my home and break that fear bubble. It was lovely to see the energy of the coaches and alumni, it really made me a little less scared, I found it intense but not at the scary pace I expected, so somehow, I could see myself being able to succeed in this course. 

They gave me some practical information on the course, like how train tickets would work and who is in charge of what aspects of the course, who you can reach out to in case you get stuck.

Check out Front End Masters. Com

Check out Boot camp - Use it to build up experience and a portfolio like an internship

You have one mandatory homework assignment 
Your homework assignment should have a live demo active and be present in your Github repository.

If you feel lost, there is a catch up session on Wednesday and you can re-watch the class on vimeo.
It is very important to arrive at class early, there is a lot of information to go though and not a lot of time. You should always make sure you are prepared before class.

The goals of each week should be 

-To learn 

-To get stuck 

-To ask help 

-To give help 

-To do your homework 

-To SLEEP

Make sure you have everything you need, placing big emphasis on Git and Github. 

Git is the software Github uses, a repository. You publish this in Github so you can share, fork and collaborate.

Visual studio code is the software you actually write code in. Explore and download a few extensions to help you code like a real developer. The extensions Linter will flag issues and prettier will change code to a acceptable standard

To create a markdown project. 

Create a folder on you PC  

Open folder on VScode  

Create file in VScode 

Toggle preview so you can see your code visually live 

Remember to add a licence, this is to allow the continuous editing freedom of the web we love so much. 

About the eggs:
You have 3 types of homework assignment classified as eggs; 

The whole egg is mandatory and basic training it has to be finished  

The egg hatching is more advanced and is expected to be started  

The hatching is a challenge, something that you can go back to or explore if you have some free time

# Project One


What is **Markdown**?
>Focuss on content and easy to learn

>Similar way to write HTML

>Pretty much just text, although it does have elements and tables

>Identified as .mb at the end of file

# Basic Styles in Markdown

Using Markdown is a great way to focus on your writing and content rather than complex code

I find it more helpful to write the actual text in a word document so that I may check my spelling and grammar linguistically speaking. VScode seems to care more about my coding grammar than my English. 

Find a VScode editor that checks linguistic grammar

# Navigating Git and GitHub

Shaky at best I am currently just looking through my bookmarked pages to find what I am looking for, I do not really know why navigation is so difficult for me, but here I am.
