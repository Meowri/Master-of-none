# Learning to code

Learning to code is a bit like going to the gym. Even if you max out and
spent a whole weekend at the gym, you will not see a visible difference in
your body. The more regularly you learn to code, the more likely it is that
you’ll start seeing your ripped coding muscles.

There is nothing more difficult than trying to convince your
work-saturated brain to sit down and learn when you could be watching
Game of Thrones with a tub of ice-cream.

Once I got started coding and making things, I got so absorbed into the
project, that I no longer cared about TV, food or sleep.

This is why the moment you enter the door and change to a new
environment is the most crucial moment. If at this moment, you tell yourself
that you are just going to do 20 minutes of coding practice, you will most
likely succeed

The next step is to develop a habit. Research suggests that in order to
develop a new habit, you have to carry out the task daily for a month.

# Code for a reason

As long at the end of the tutorial, you’ll have made something you can use
and play with, then you’ll be far more motivated to code to the end.

# All code are created equal

A programming language is simply a tool. It is no different from any other
tool in your hardware box. If you want to hammer a nail, you should be
using a hammer. If you want to fix your water pipes, you’ll probably need a
spanner. Yes, it’s possible to hammer in a nail using the side of the spanner
and the same programming language can be used to solve different types of
problems. The carpenter will tell you that his favourite tool is a hammer and
the plumber will say it’s the spanner, but it still doesn’t make it the “best
tool to fix things”.

But the good
news is the core programming concepts: loops, conditionals, functions, etc.
they’re all the same. The difference is mostly syntactical.

# Understand what you are writing

The most common problem is a student
who just copies the code in the tutorial and has no clue what any of it does.
Why did he add that extra line after parsing the JSON? Why is he making
this dictionary differently from the last one?

The key to learning to code is all about ramping. You want to be stretched
over and over again and for knowledge to be built on previous knowledge. If
that ramp is too steep, you’ll get lost. If that ramp is too shallow, you’ll get
bored. The right gradient is different for everyone.

# You know nothing Code-adawan

Anybody who has worked as a
software engineer will tell you that not looking at references is far more
frowned upon. In fact, I challenge you to find a single Google programmer
who has not used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

### The skill that most employers look for when recruiting is the ability to think.

The skill you need to hone is in asking good questions and understanding the
answer.Although, there is no point copy-pasting code from a StackOverflow answer if
you have no clue how it works.

# Be a copycat

Lacking in ideas? Be a copycat.

Not only will they be sort-of useful, but
they’ll also be the perfect opportunity for you to figure out how to do things
and get experience in finding help.

## I read. I highlighted. I forgot. I fell asleep.

# Be accountable to someone. Show your work.
## #HYFGOALS

Internal motivation is not strong in any of us. We can always
find a reason why we deserve to “Netflix and chill”.

# Being a good programmer is a bit like being Madonna.
## Keep learning

Programming will keep evolving. In order to stay relevant, you have to keep
re-inventing yourself.

# When you see developers enjoying their foosball game, laughing and joking,
they’re probably suffering inside. For there’s a bug, there’s always a bug.

Maybe the code is working perfectly, but unexpectedly. Like if they just typed out a thousand
lines in one go,and unexpectedly there are no errors...

but in these situations, it’s almost always worth stepping away from your code and giving it some time and distance.

In 9 out of 10 cases, the solution will become
apparent. In the remaining 1 out of 10 cases, you’re just screwed.

_always to code less, think more. Once the poorly thought-out code is written and brought into the
world, you’ll inevitably have to go back and comb through your code,
line-by-line, refactoring and deleting things. This is always a painful
experience_

So remember, the easiest code to get rid of is the code that was never written

#  Mr. Miyagi

Good mentors don’t solve your problems, rather they practice the Socratic
method of asking good questions that get you to think for yourself.

# Break each module down

The more that you break down problems and define the issue that you’re
trying to solve, the easier it is to package your code into bite-sized chunks.
The simpler the chunk, the easier it is to tackle.

Everyone needs help. Everyone, including those so-called “God Level
Programmers”.

On a site like StackOverflow, it can be very tempting to just copy and
paste the code that someone has provided. Your program works exactly as
you hoped it would and off you go on your merry programming ways. This
exercise didn’t teach you anything other than code reliance. Because the
next time you encounter the same problem but in a different situation, that
same code snippet that someone provided may not work anymore. Then
what do you do? You’re stuck.

__That’s why there’s a rule in programming that says “never copypaste code
that you don’t understand”__

-Step 1 - Copy and paste the code into your program. (yes, yes, I know I just
said not to do that, patience, patience).

-Step 2 - Make sure that your program or application is functioning as
expected. I.e. confirm that block of code really did solve your problem.

-Step 3 - Delete the copy and pasted block of code line by line.

-Step 4 - Each time you delete a line, check to see what’s been broken. Does
the app still run? What are the error codes? What has deleting that line of
code done to your program?

-Step 5 - Even if you think you know what a line of code does, delete it
anyway. The most important task as a programmer is to always test your
assumptions against the outcome. For the most enjoyable feeling as a
programmer is for the real world to validate your assumptions. You know
how nice it is when your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife says those
magical three words?
“You were right”.
It’s like that, but better.

-Step 6 - Swap some of the lines around. Can the same functionality be
achieved with a different order of lines? Why were they written in the order
they were written in?


By breaking the solution code, line-by-line, you’ll learn and understand what each line does and why it’s been written.
